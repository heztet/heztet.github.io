I don't find these keyboard shortcuts surprising, but it *is* surprising that I never thought to try it on
an iPad. With the [new screenshot tool](https://9to5mac.com/2018/07/17/macos-mojave-how-to-use-new-screenshot-and-screencast-tools-without-grab/)
in macOS Mojave, I wonder what other features will reach parity on macOS and iOS in the future.
