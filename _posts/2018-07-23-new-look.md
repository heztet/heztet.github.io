I've owned this domain ([nickymarino.com](nickymarino.com)) for roughly three years now, and so far I've only used it as a resume/portfolio site. I've finally found a theme that I both appreciate and can spend time modifying to fit my needs. 

My goal is to start writing (and podcasting!) more often, whether it's a technical detail I found interesting, an overcome challenge I want to record for when I encounter it again, or anything else I can think of. 

I have a few ideas up my sleeve.
