Trey Harris, writing [to sage-members](https://www.ibiblio.org/harris/500milemail.html):

>I was working in a job running the campus email system some years ago when I got a call from the chairman of the statistics department.
>
>"We're having a problem sending email out of the department."
>
>"What's the problem?" I asked.
>
>"We can't send mail more than 500 miles," the chairman explained.
>
>I choked on my latte.  "Come again?"
>
>"We can't send mail farther than 500 miles from here," he repeated.  "A little bit more, actually.  Call it 520 miles.  But no farther."

While it's an older story, it's a fantastic one. And it's a great reminder to check your software versions.
