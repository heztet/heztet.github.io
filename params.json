{"name":"Nicky Marino","tagline":"First Year Engineering Student at Purdue","body":"![My Siblings and I](http://nickymarino.me/images/siblings.jpg)\r\n<br>\r\nHello! My name is Nicky Marino, and this webpage is just a little \"landing ground\" for some info about myself. I'm from a family of five and am the oldest child of three. The picture above are of my siblings (Sophia and Tony) and me. I come from Greenwood, Indiana, which is a small city just south of Indianapolis. \r\n\r\n### Coding Background\r\nWhile I haven't had any school classes in computer programming or design, it's certainly become one of my main hobbies. I've spent lots of time in [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/). I have a working knowledge of Ruby and Visual Basic as well as the main web languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In fact, over the summer I interned at Freedom Mortgage. My role was to help develop the back end databases as well as design the front end forms. In other words, my colleagues and I created tables to store information and then display that data to be organized and edited. \r\n\r\n### Shreve Club\r\nOne of my main goals as webmaster of [Shreve Club](http://shreveclub.org) would be to provide information about events as quickly and easily as possible. This includes the basics of any well-maintained website: updated, accurate, and simple. Likewise, the site should be maintained so that ownership can be easily transferred. In time, I would also like to develop an iOS app (similar to [BoilerGuide](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/boilerguide/id591920127?mt=8)) for Shreve residents to easily look for upcoming information.\r\n\r\n### \"I want to learn how to code/develop websites! Where can I start?\"\r\nHere are a few of the places I used to learn:\r\n* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) has tutorials over many, many languages and APIs\r\n* [Python](https://www.python.org/) is simple to learn yet immensely powerful and is used world-wide by scientists and STEM industries\r\n* [Learn Code The Hard Way](http://learncodethehardway.org/) has lessons over various languages that teach coding conventions and logic in addition to syntax and structure\r\n* [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) will have the answer to nearly any coding issue\r\n* [Google](https://www.google.com/) is always your friend\r\n\r\n### \"I saw that button at the top. What is GitHub?\"\r\n[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a place to store and edit code for various projects. The company provides version control to keep track of changes automatically and allow more than one person to work on a project at the same time. Google Docs is for writing papers; GitHub is for writing software.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
