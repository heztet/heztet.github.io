I'm Nicky Marino, and I'm a developer with a degree in Computer Engineering from Purdue University.

## Past Projects

I was the Head Teaching Assistant for Purdue's [Honors Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Honors) intro course, where we covered a variety of topics including teamwork, project management, scripting, and solving real world problems. I was head of the software team, which handles the behind-the-scenes scripts and tools to help the class run smoothly.

I worked with a team of 3 other students to build an ASIC [RC4/SD Card encryption](https://github.com/nickymarino/ece337project) design.

I designed the CMS and attendance tracking app for [Phoenix Club](https://github.com/nickymarino/phoenixclub).

I've built a number of small Twitter bots, such as [Greyhouse Status](https://twitter.com/greyhousestatus).
