Check out my [GitHub profile page]({{ site.author.github }}).

I'm Nicky Marino, and I'm an AI Engineer working at [ModelOp](https://www.modelop.com) to deploy, monitor, and govern machine learning models at scale. I grew up in the suburbs of Indianapolis and studied Computer Engineering at Purdue University. I have a passion for both writing and teaching software development.

## Past Projects

I was the Head Teaching Assistant for [Purdue Honors Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/Honors), where we covered a variety of topics including teamwork, project management, scripting, and solving real world problems. I lead the software team of ~10 colleagues to automatically collect, grade, and report homework submissions for over 300 students weekly.

I implemented an efficient, reliable method to read and edit RFID tags with a [TI MSP430](http://www.ti.com/microcontrollers/msp430-ultra-low-power-mcus/overview.html) microcontroller and a Node frontend for [Indesign, LLC](https://indesign-llc.com).

I designed and managed an automated system to collect, parse, and store NOAA weather reports on a daily basis for [Consumers Energy](https://www.consumersenergy.com).

I built the CMS for [Phoenix Club](https://github.com/nickymarino/phoenixclub) to manage the attendance records of nearly 100 students at weekly meetings.

I worked with a team of 3 other students to build an ASIC [RC4/SD Card encryption](https://github.com/nickymarino/ece337project) design.
