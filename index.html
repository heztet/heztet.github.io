Hello! My name is Nicky Marino, and this webpage is just a little "landing ground" for some info about myself. Currently I'm an FYE student at Purdue University. I come from a family of five and am the oldest child of three. I come from Greenwood, Indiana, which is a small city just south of Indianapolis. </p>

<p>While I haven't had any school classes in computer programming or design, it's certainly become one of my main hobbies. I've spent lots of time in <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>. I have a working knowledge of Ruby and Visual Basic as well as the main web languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In fact, over the summer I interned at Freedom Mortgage. My role was to help develop the back end databases as well as design the front end forms. In other words, my colleagues and I created tables to store information and then display that data to be organized and edited. </p>

<a id="shreve-club" class="anchor" href="#shreve-club" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Shreve Club</h3>

<p>One of my main goals as webmaster of <a href="http://shreveclub.org">Shreve Club</a> would be to provide information about events as quickly and easily as possible. This includes the basics of any well-maintained website: updated, accurate, and simple. Likewise, the site should be maintained so that ownership can be easily transferred. In time, I would also like to develop an iOS app (similar to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/boilerguide/id591920127?mt=8">BoilerGuide</a>) for Shreve residents to easily look for upcoming information.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> is a place to store and edit code for various projects. The company provides version control to keep track of changes automatically and allow more than one person to work on a project at the same time. Google Docs is for writing papers; GitHub is for writing software.</p>
